This guide is for family, friends and anyone else that would like to use another form of a brain wallet.

Be careful on your choice of words. In theory, it seems you could pick the simplest word set but make your "Passphrase" very unique and lengthy along with a multisig 4 of 4 using a ranged number set of derivation paths spanning over 1000 in a unique order other than chronological order and that should be quite secure. Thinking this through a little, the attacker would have to create a script to go through all the simple word sets that work, (Many don't work, try Abandon 12 times. There are technical reasons why this doesn't work.) then for each word set, generate billions upon billions of Passphrases possibilities, then go through trillions upon trillions of derivation path keys used for each keystore, then (assuming you used these 12 words three time in a row for each keystore) guess what other 12 words you used for the other 3 keystores. All this and then take that data and scan the timechain for any activity on those addresses. To meâ€¦. this seems beyond very unlikely. If I'm missing something and this is extremely stupid, hopefully someone points of any attack vectors I'm missing.

Always do a test transaction with new wallet methods or anything you're doing out of the norm
